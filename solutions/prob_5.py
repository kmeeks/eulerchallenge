'''Project Euler - Problem 5
   Smallest Multiple

   2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

   What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

   To evaluate this, use principles of Least Common Multiple and utilize the max number of prime factors for each value.
