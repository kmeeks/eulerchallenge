# Project Euler 100 Challenge

Personal repository for the Project Euler 100 challenge in 2020.
Solutions provided in Python 3.7.6 environment.

The project uses the memory_profiler module to help measure the
efficiency of the solutions. To execute a solution for one of the
problems included in this project run:

    `python3 run.py prob_1`

In the command above `prob_1` could be replaced with a reference to
any one of the solutions in the solutions directory.
